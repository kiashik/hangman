# Project Hangman Criteria:

2. hangman will have 6 parts(6 attempts).
3. if the guess is wrong, all the wrong guesses are shown. a part of the hangman is added.
4. number of characters is shown to users. 
5. if all 6 attempts are used, say you lost. and display the correct answer.
6. otherwise say you won.
7. lower or upper case doesn't matter.

# RULES:
1. No words with repeating letters are allowed.
2. No sentences or phrases with spaces in between is allowed.
3. Six attempts allowed.

# Improvments:
Currently, the game is not very fun or convenient to play. It would be a lot better if the program could pick a word randomly(maybe from a category). this way the game will be single-player playable. 
Or the program could pick a word from a list(predetermined or received from the player), then the player will play as usual. this will make the game playable single or double player.
